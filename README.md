## ‚ùó Notes for `vision-camera`

- If you're using **Frame Processors**, ensure the host app also installs `react-native-worklets-core`.
- If you're building a **Vision Camera Frame Processor Plugin**, you'll need extra native setup (let me know if you're doing that and I can walk you through it).

---

## Usage

Simply add the hook `useExtractCameraDevices();` into your app initialization script

```ts
import { useExtractCameraDevices } from 'react-native-vision-camera-devices-extractor';

// ...

useExtractCameraDevices();
```
